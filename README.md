# NoSQL Social Network API
![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description
Back-end for a basic social networking app using a NoSQL database. API routes adhere to standard CRUD methodology, allowing users to create/read/update/delete new Users as well as user Thoughts. Users can be linked to one another via "friends" lists. Users can react to Thoughts by creating Reactions. 

Watch a complete demo of the API routes tested in Insomnia [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POxehrW0r7bcL5YPusQLmNenhK7H431z/view).
